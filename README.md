# CDA3103FinalProject

In this project, we were assigned to write the core part of a mini processor simulator called MySPIM using C language on a Unix or a PC platform. 
MySPIM will demonstrate some functions of MIPS processor as well as the principle of the datapath and the control signals of MIPS processor.
The MySPIM simulator should read in a file containing MIPS machine codes (in the format specified below) and simulate what the MIPS does cycle-by-cycle.
